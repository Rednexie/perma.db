Perma.db is a node.js database management library, uses better-sqlite3 under the hood. 


You use both SQL and No-SQL systems inside one module.


# Perma.db is;


As fast as redis, since it uses caching. But it is consistent too.


Easier to use than quick.db, since you can use it with a single database. But it takes up less space.


# Has features like: 


Backup function, copy your database into a file.


"Better" sqlite3 integration, sqlite3 usage is just a function away.


Customizable, you can determine which ones to use.
