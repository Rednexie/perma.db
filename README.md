# Perma.db is;


As fast as redis, since it uses caching. But it is also consistent.


Easier to use than quick.db, since you can use it with a single database. It takes up less space, though.


A library, which can be counted as both SQL and no-SQL.


# Has features like: 


Backup function, copy your database into a file.


"Better" sqlite3 integration, sqlite3 usage is just a function away.


Customizable, you can determine which ones to use.


You can use both SQL and No-SQL with perma.db. Either execute a query, or get a key's value from the database.
